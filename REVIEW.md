# Review

Failure here is a green run that did not test, or a red run that blocked a change nobody read. Style is not a finding.

- Cap nits at zero. Do not post style, diagnostics, or cleanup.
- A finding names a file and a line in the diff. A guess from a name is not a finding.
- Tag every finding Important, Nit, or Pre-existing. A bug this change did not introduce is Pre-existing.
- The summary starts with a count and says when there is nothing to fix.
- Re-review only the new diff. Do not repeat a finding already posted. After three rounds, stop and reconsider the approach.
- An agent's approval is not a person's. The person who prompted the change is the author.
- Risk comes from the diff.
  - Low: docs and copy. No further person once defect review and security review are green.
  - Medium: ordinary changes. One person, the author. The commit messages carry Testing, Risk, and How to revert.
  - High: iam, kms, auth, authz, billing, pay, release, installer, and any workflow file. Those three lines are required before release.
